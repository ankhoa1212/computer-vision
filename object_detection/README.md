The `object_detection.py` script defines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks.

The network processes input images and classifies them into one of 10 predefined classes. 

It consists of convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers 
for classification. 

The resulting model created from the script can be found in the `models` folder in the native Keras format.
